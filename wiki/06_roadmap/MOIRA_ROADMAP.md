### Deferred doctrine candidate — Astrodynes / Cosmodynes

Status: deferred

Reason:
- Moira can support this structurally as a derived doctrine/scoring subsystem.
- Publicly accessible Church of Light material is sufficient for research and
  source mapping, but not sufficient to reproduce the full method faithfully.
- The authoritative computational tables and exact scoring rules appear to live
  in primary manual/course material not currently available in complete form.

Constraint:
- Do not implement an approximate or blended "power score" and label it
  astrodynes/cosmodynes.
- Keep this family deferred until Moira has enough primary-source detail to
  name the doctrine, implement the scoring rules explicitly, and validate them
  against authoritative examples.

Unblocker:
- Obtain the authoritative Astrodyne / Cosmodyne manual or equivalent primary
  formula tables and worked examples sufficient for a source-faithful build.

---

## Part I — Remaining Open Features

All three original public-surface wiring gaps are now closed.  No open Part I
items remain from the original roadmap.

### ~~6. Heliacal Rising & Setting — public surface gap~~  `Done`

`heliacal_rising()` and `heliacal_setting()` are exported from `moira.__all__`
and tested in `tests/unit/test_public_surface_gaps.py`.

---

### ~~13. Hayz / In Sect — public surface gap~~  `Done`

`is_in_hayz()`, `is_in_sect()`, `SectStateKind`, `SectTruth`, and
`SectClassification` are exported from `moira.__all__` and tested in
`tests/unit/test_public_surface_gaps.py`.

---

### ~~Varga / divisional charts — public surface gap~~  `Done`

`varga.py` (`navamsa`, `calculate_varga`, `dashamansa`, `dwadashamsa`,
`saptamsa`, `trimshamsa`, `VargaPoint`) wired into `moira.__init__` and
`moira.__all__`; tested in `tests/unit/test_public_surface_gaps.py`.

---

## Part II — Mathematical Accuracy Improvements

Status reflects work done since the original roadmap entry.

### A. Ayanamsa: Star-anchored TRUE_* systems  `HIGH IMPACT` — **Done**

`ayanamsa()` now routes `mode="true"` calls for systems in `_STAR_ANCHORED`
through `_star_anchored_ayanamsa()`, which calls `fixed_star_at()` for the
anchor star at the requested JD and computes `star_tropical_lon − target_sidereal`.

Affected systems: `TRUE_CHITRAPAKSHA` (Spica = 180°), `TRUE_REVATI`
(Revati = 0°), `ALDEBARAN_15_TAU` (Aldebaran = 45°), `TRUE_PUSHYA`
(Asellus Australis = 106.667°).

`Ayanamsa.LAHIRI` remains epoch-anchored (23°15′00.658″ at 21 Mar 1956),
matching `SE_SIDM_LAHIRI` in SwissEph — Lahiri is not star-anchored by doctrine.

Polynomial `mode="mean"` path unchanged for all systems (fallback and research).

Verified: Spica sidereal longitude = 180.000° ± 0.001° at J1956, J2000, J2020.
Tests: `tests/unit/test_sidereal.py` (50 tests).

---

### B. Vertex Calculation  `HIGH IMPACT` — **Done**

Vertex is now populated in `calculate_houses()`:
```python
vertex = _asc_from_armc((armc + 90.0) % 360.0, obliquity, -latitude)
```

---

### C. Topocentric Correction: WGS-84 Elevation Term  `MEDIUM IMPACT` — **Done**

`corrections.py::topocentric_correction()` already uses the full WGS-84
geodetic model:
- `f = 1.0 / 298.257223563` (WGS-84 flattening)
- `a = EARTH_RADIUS_KM = 6378.137` (equatorial radius, km)
- elevation converted to km and applied via the standard C/S auxiliary values

The roadmap entry was written before this work was completed.

---

### D. Apparent Sidereal Time: IAU 2006 GAST  `MEDIUM IMPACT` — **Done**

Already fully implemented in `julian.py`:
- `greenwich_mean_sidereal_time()` uses `θ_ERA` (IAU 2000) as foundation plus the
  Capitaine et al. (2003) 5th-order polynomial correction (SOFA `iauGmst06`).
- `_gast_complementary_terms()` implements all 9 periodic terms from IERS 2010
  Table 5.2c (dominant term 0.00264″ from Moon's node Ω; total ≤ 0.04″).
- `apparent_sidereal_time()` computes GAST = GMST + Δψ·cos(ε) + CT.

The roadmap entry was written before this work was completed.  Agreement with
SOFA `iauGmst06` is better than 0.0001″ for 1800–2200.

---

### E. Delta-T: IERS Bulletin data  `MEDIUM IMPACT` — **Done**

`_DELTA_T_ANNUAL` in `julian.py` updated with 12-month arithmetic means from
USNO `deltat.data` (source: maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/deltat.data, fetched 2026-03-22).
2015–2025 are fully observed; 2026 uses the Jan 2026 IERS Bulletin A value (~69.1 s).

Key corrections vs. prior table (observed overestimates):
- 2022: 69.6 → 69.25 (−0.35 s)
- 2023: 69.5 → 69.20 (−0.30 s)
- 2024: 69.4 → 69.17 (−0.23 s)
- 2025: 69.3 → 69.13 (−0.17 s)

The 1955–2015 blend point was also fixed to reference `_DELTA_T_ANNUAL[0]`
directly rather than a hardcoded literal, so future table updates auto-propagate.

---

### F. Topocentric tag on Chart positions  `MEDIUM IMPACT` — **Done**

`PlanetData` (in `planets.py`) already carries `is_topocentric: bool = False`
and `planets.py::planet_at()` populates it from the `_topocentric` local at
line 589.  `FixedStar` and `GaiaStarPosition` carry the same field.  All
three result vessels surface the geocentric/topocentric distinction explicitly.

---

### G. Fixed Star Proper Motion: Epoch and Reference Frame  `LOW IMPACT` — **Done**

`fixed_stars.py` already handles per-entry epoch correctly:
- ICRS-tagged entries (Hipparcos-sourced) use `_J1991_25 = 2448349.0625` as
  the propagation start epoch.
- J2000 and B1950 entries use their stated epochs.
- `pm_ra` is stored and applied as `μ_α*` (i.e. `μ_α · cos δ`, the reduced
  form), which is documented in `_apply_proper_motion()`.

The roadmap entry was written before this work was completed.

---

### H. Obliquity: Unify P03 Throughout  `LOW IMPACT` — **Done**

`obliquity.py::mean_obliquity()` already delegates directly to
`precession.mean_obliquity_p03` (imported as `_mean_obliquity_p03`).  There
is no divergent polynomial — the module docstring explicitly states "IAU 2006
P03 / Capitaine, Wallace & Chapront 2003".  The roadmap entry was written
before this unification was confirmed.

---

### I. Equation of the Equinoxes: Full Periodic Terms  `LOW IMPACT` — **Done**

`julian.py::_gast_complementary_terms()` already implements all 9 periodic
terms from IERS 2010 Conventions Table 5.2c (reference: SOFA `iauEect00`).
The dominant term (Moon's node Ω) reaches ±0.00264″; the full series sums
to ≤0.04″.  `apparent_sidereal_time()` adds these CT terms on top of
`Δψ·cos(ε)`.  The roadmap entry predated this implementation.

---

### J. Aspects: Stationary Planet State  `LOW IMPACT` — **Done**

`aspects.py` already defines `MotionState` with values `APPLYING`,
`SEPARATING`, `STATIONARY`, `INDETERMINATE`, and `NONE`, plus the
`aspect_motion_state()` function that derives the correct state from any
aspect vessel.  The `bool | None` ambiguity is fully resolved.

---

- `OPTICAL` — chance alignment confirmed by Gaia DR3 parallax: Albireo

**Catalog:**
| System | Type | Highlight |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Sirius | VISUAL | Sirius B (white dwarf) orbital mechanics; Dogon/esoteric significance |
| Castor | WIDE | Sextuple system — three nested binaries; Gemini's duality made literal |

### Harmograms Subsystem — `harmograms/`  **Done** (2026-04-04)

Mathematically explicit harmograms engine built in visible strata rather than
as one opaque score.

**Implemented strata:**
- H1 spectral foundations:
  - point-set harmonic vectors
  - zero-Aries parts construction
  - zero-Aries parts harmonic vectors
- H2 intensity doctrine:
  - named intensity families
  - conjunction inclusion policy
  - explicit normalization and harmonic-domain policy
- H3 projection layer:
  - explicit spectral projection vessels
  - truncated-realization classification carried visibly
- H4 trace layer:
  - named trace families
  - time-domain harmogram traces over supplied snapshots
- H5 research tooling:
  - contributor ranking
  - spectrum comparison
  - trace-series comparison

**Admitted intensity families:**
- cosine bell
- top hat
- triangular
- gaussian

**Admitted trace families:**
- dynamic zero-Aries parts
- transit-to-natal zero-Aries parts
- directed-to-natal zero-Aries parts
- progressed-to-natal zero-Aries parts

**Public engine shape:**
- selected stable types and computation surfaces exported from `moira.__init__`
- no facade-first harmogram workflow has been frozen
- service/workflow orchestration remains intentionally outside the engine core

**Bridge layer present:**
- `bridges/harmograms.py`
- native `Chart` / `ProgressedChart` / mapping adapters
- explicit body-selection filters
- progression-family sample builders
- datetime-range chart sampling builders

This keeps the engine boundary clean:
- mathematics in `moira.harmograms`
- expressive adaptation in `moira.bridges`
- no service-layer canonization in `moira.facade`
