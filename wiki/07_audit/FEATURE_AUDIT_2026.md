**Audit date:** 2026-05-15  
**Moira commit:** 8fc17b8efb1fa38723458d4f851520183d93ecf9  
**Auditor:** TheDaniel166  
**Method:** 12-domain coverage matrix. Moira assessed from code inspection; competitors from public documentation (manuals, feature pages, tutorials).

**Cell scoring:** ✓ full | ~ partial | ✗ absent | ? unclear  
**Gap types:** A = missing feature | B = depth gap  
**Priority:** D + C + T score → P1 (7–9) | P2 (5–6) | P3 (3–4)

## 1. Body Coverage

Moira's body coverage spans the full solar system: all classical and modern planets
(Sun through Pluto), mean and true nodes (lunar + planetary), Black Moon Lilith (mean
and true osculating), a fixed-star catalog of 1,809 stars (star_registry.csv), 15
Behenian and 4 Royal stars, variable stars, 369-entry asteroid catalog (ASTEROID_NAIF),
classical asteroids (Ceres, Pallas, Juno, Vesta), 6 centaurs (Chiron, Pholus, Nessus,
Asbolus, Chariklo, Hylonome), TNOs (Eris, Sedna, Quaoar, Makemake, Haumea, Ixion,
Varuna, Orcus, Gonggong, and others in ASTEROID_NAIF), 5 periodic comets (Halley,
Encke, Tempel 1, Churyumov-Gerasimenko, Swift-Tuttle), multiple star systems with
orbital mechanics, and 9 Uranian/Hamburg hypothetical bodies (Cupido, Hades, Zeus,
Kronos, Apollon, Admetos, Vulkanus, Poseidon, Transpluto).

**Gap notes:**  
Moira's body coverage is exceptional — it exceeds all 8 competitors in catalog breadth. No Type A gaps identified. Possible Type B: Moira's extended asteroid catalog stands at 369 named bodies (ASTEROID_NAIF); Sirius claims the largest commercial catalog and may exceed this count — verify. Fixed star catalog at 1,809 entries (star_registry.csv) is competitive with commercial leaders. Variable stars, comets (5 periodic), multiple star systems with orbital mechanics, and SSB access are unique to Moira among this competitor set. Uranian suite covers all 8 Hamburg bodies plus Transpluto (9 total).

## 2. House Systems & Chart Frames

Moira implements house cusps via `houses.py` using ARMC, obliquity, and geographic
coordinates. The engine supports fallback from polar-incompatible systems (Placidus,
Koch) to Porphyry above the critical latitude (~66.56°). Huber houses are in a
separate module. Galactic, geodetic, local space, and Gauquelin sectors are also
separate specialized modules.

**Gap notes:**  
Moira's house system breadth is strong — all 17 systems in `HouseSystem` (including
Alcabitius, Meridian, Azimuthal, Vehlow, Krusinski, Topocentric, Carter, APC, and
Sunshine) are confirmed in `_KNOWN_SYSTEMS` and fully operational. The Sunshine system
(code "N", Makransky 1988) places the Sun at cusp 12, which is a distinct variant from
the traditional solar sign frame where the Sun's sign occupies house 1.

Two gaps identified against the competitor matrix:

**Solar sign frame (Sun on cusp 1) — Type A gap:** The traditional solar sign/solar
house frame (ASC replaced by the Sun's sign cusp so that the Sun's sign = house 1) is
absent. Moira's SUNSHINE system is the structurally different Makransky variant (Sun at
cusp 12). Solar Fire, Sirius, Janus, Astro.com, Astro-Seek, Co-Star, and TimePassages
all offer the traditional solar sign frame (7 of 8 competitors). D=2, C=5, T=2 → P1.

**Derived houses (from any cusp) — Type A gap:** No module or function provides
derived/turned house calculation (rotating the house wheel so that any chosen cusp
becomes the new ASC/1st house). Solar Fire, Sirius, Janus, and Astro-Seek support
this (4 of 8 competitors). D=1, C=4, T=2 → P2.
