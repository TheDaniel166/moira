Moira — light_cone.py: Received-Light Chart Engine
====================================================

Archetype: Engine

Purpose
-------
Governs computation of "received-light" positions — the ecliptic
coordinates of celestial bodies as they were when the light that reached
Earth at the birth moment was actually emitted.

Standard astrological positions already incorporate light-time correction
(the body's position is computed for the moment t − τ, where τ is the
one-way light travel time).  This engine makes the light-cone geometry
*explicit* by surfacing:

  - The *apparent* ecliptic position (where the body was when it emitted
    the received light, i.e. the standard corrected position).
  - The *geometric* ecliptic position (where the body physically is at the
    birth moment, without any light-time correction).
  - The *light travel time* τ in days and minutes.
  - The *emission Julian Day* (jd_ut − τ): the instant when the photons
    now arriving at Earth were released.
  - The *longitude displacement*: the angular shift between where the body
    appears (apparent) and where it actually is (geometric) — a direct
    measure of the light-cone parallax.

Physical context
----------------
Light travel times at J2000.0 are approximately:

    Moon       ~1.3 s   (< 0.0001°  displacement)
    Sun        ~8.3 min (~0.004° displacement — fast-moving luminaries
                         can show up to ~0.02° in extreme cases)
    Mars       ~4–20 min
    Jupiter    ~35–52 min (~0.04–0.06° displacement)
    Saturn     ~68–84 min
    Uranus     ~2.7 h
    Neptune    ~4.1 h
    Pluto      ~5.3 h   (~0.25–0.35° displacement — detectable in
                         precise work)

For inner planets, the displacement is sub-degree; for the outer solar
system it can reach a third of a degree or more, comparable in magnitude
to a tight orb.

Boundary declaration
--------------------
Owns: ``ReceivedLightPosition`` vessel, ``RECEIVED_LIGHT_BODIES``,
      ``received_light_at``, ``all_received_light_at``.
Delegates: apparent and geometric position computation to
           ``moira.planets.planet_at``, constants to ``moira.constants``.

Import-time side effects: None

External dependency assumptions
--------------------------------
Requires the DE441 kernel to be initialised (same requirement as
``moira.planets.planet_at``).

Public surface
--------------
``ReceivedLightPosition``   — vessel for a single received-light position.
``RECEIVED_LIGHT_BODIES``   — frozenset of body names for which
                              received-light positions can be computed.
``received_light_at``       — received-light position for one body.
``all_received_light_at``   — received-light positions for all supported bodies.

    RITE: The Received-Light Position Vessel.

    THEOREM: Holds both the apparent ecliptic position of a body (where it
    was when the light reaching Earth at the birth moment was emitted) and
    the geometric position (where the body physically is at the birth
    instant), along with the light-cone parameters that connect them.

    The ``sign``, ``sign_symbol``, and ``sign_degree`` fields reflect the
    *apparent* longitude — the position an astrologer would use.

    Structural invariants
    ---------------------
    - ``apparent_longitude`` and ``geometric_longitude`` are both in
      [0°, 360°).
    - ``sign``, ``sign_symbol``, ``sign_degree`` are always consistent with
      ``apparent_longitude`` after ``__post_init__`` completes.
    - ``retrograde`` is consistent with the apparent (light-time corrected)
      longitudinal speed.
    - ``light_travel_days`` is always ≥ 0.
    - ``emission_jd < jd_ut`` for all physical bodies with finite distance.

    Compute the received-light position of ``body`` at the given Julian Date.

    The apparent position is derived from ``planet_at(apparent=True)``,
    which applies the full light-time correction pipeline.  The geometric
    position is derived from ``planet_at(apparent=False)``.  The light
    travel time is inferred from the apparent (light-time corrected)
    distance:

        τ (days) = distance_km / C_KM_PER_DAY

    Parameters
    ----------
    body   : Body name (``Body.*`` constant).  Must be in
             ``RECEIVED_LIGHT_BODIES``.
    jd_ut  : Julian Day Number in Universal Time (UT1).
    reader : An open ``SpkReader`` instance.  If ``None``, the module-level
             singleton from ``moira.planets.get_reader()`` is used.

    ReceivedLightPosition — apparent and geometric positions, light-cone
    parameters, and zodiac data.

    Raises
    ------

    Notes
    -----
    The light travel time is computed from the iteratively-converged
    light-time corrected distance already embedded in the ``planet_at``
    apparent pipeline.  No additional iteration is performed here.

    The ``speed`` and ``retrograde`` fields reflect the *apparent*
    (light-time corrected) longitudinal rate, consistent with all other
    Moira position products.  Speed is always the geocentric astrometric
    rate as returned by ``planet_at``.
